In how many different ways the below function can calle?

def my_function(num1 = 100, num2 = 400):
    return num1 - num2

print(my_function(None, 20))
print(my_function(None, None))
print(my_function(20, None))
my_function(10, 20)
my_function(10)
my_function()
my_function(num1 = 25)
my_function(None, 20)
my_function(num2 = 25)
my_function(num2 = 25, num1 = 99)
my_function(num1 = 25, num2 = 99)

list in Python
list as a DS
What is a DS?
Birth of a DS like list/array
implimentation of an array in memory using addresses and adress arithmetic
Uses
Pros and Cons
Alternatives
Beyond list

Its a collection of items/data
All the items are stored in contigious memory locations. That is if you any 2 consecutive elements, then there is no gap in between them.
list, specifically in Python need not be of the same type as in the case of C/C++/Java etc.

What is a DS?
int numbers[10]; // DS
int num1, num2, num3, num4, num5; // May or may not be a DS

The lookup (accessing any element in the array/list) is one unit time.
Thus the efficiency of accessing an element in the array is O(1)
Usually size of an array is fixed. Because of which there are almost always chances of either wastage of memory or shortage of memory.
Thus, an array is time efficient DS but memory inefficienct DS.

Assume size value is given by user at runtime
float *numbers = new float[size];
float[] numbers = new float[size];

float numbers[20];

Good example of list/array:
To store names of girls of SIC training.
To store distances of the places to be visited in the order of places of the trip.
Not good examples of Array/List:
To store all the UPI transactions of a specific date in the entire country.
To store details of the items bought by a customer in a mall?

list is a class in python.
We create object(s) out of a class
When we say:
n = 10
Here n is just a number. Its value 10 has not units like cm, mts or mt/sec or Hz or mts/sec square
Now say, we have a course which has a minimum duration and a maximum duration.
engg_course_duration = 4
units = 'years'
minimum_duration = 4
maximum_duration = 8

class EngineeringCourseDuration:
    duration
    unit
    minimum_duration
    maximum_duration
    maximum_per_semester

    initialize_values()
    set_duration()
    get_duration()
    set_unit()
    get_unit()
    set_maximum_duration()

class Customer
    id
    name
    father_name
    phone_number
    email
    address
    adhaar
    pan

class Account
    id
    custmoer_id
    account_number
    account_type
    branch_id
    balance

    create()
    delete()
    freeze()
    modify()
    read_details()

class Transaction
    id
    datetime
    type
    account_id

    check_balance()
    deposit()
    withdraw()
    mini_stmt()
    change_pin()
    add_beneficiary()
    transfer()

Account* account = new Account(); // C++
Account account = new Account(); // Java
account = Account() // Python

class NRIAccount : public Account {
private:
    string passportNumber;
};

class NRIAccount extends Account {
    private String passportNumber;
}

class NRIAccount (Account):
    def __init__(self):
        passportNumber = ""

names1 = []
names2 = list()

names3 = ['suresh', 'mahesh', 'girish']
other_names = list(names3)
---------------------------------------------------
list methods:
    list()  # creating + initializing
    append()
    pop()
    insert()
    remove()
    sort()
    reverse()
    extend()
