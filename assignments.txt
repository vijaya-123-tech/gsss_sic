Taxation Problem:

Tax Calculator Problem
GlobalNext Solutions, a rapidly growing IT company, employs a diverse workforce ranging from entry-
level developers to senior executives. The HR department wants to streamline the tax calculation
process for employees under the New Tax Regime (2023). They’ve decided to build a tax calculation
program that computes salaries, taxes, and net incomes while ensuring compliance with the latest tax
laws.
As a software developer in GlobalNext’s HR-Tech team, you are tasked with developing this program.
The system should process employee salary details, validate inputs, calculate taxes, and generate
detailed reports.
The program should:
1. Accept employee details, including monthly salary components.
2. Calculate gross and taxable income according to the New Tax Regime (2023).
3. Compute the tax payable using the appropriate tax slabs.
4. Apply any applicable standard deductions and rebates.
5. Generate reports detailing gross salary, taxable income, tax payable, and net salary.
Level 1: Basic Input and Salary Calculation
Objective: Capture employee details and calculate the gross salary.
Tasks:
• Accept the following inputs for an employee:
o Name
o EmpID
o Basic Monthly Salary
o Special Allowances (Monthly)
o Bonus Percentage (Annual Bonus as % of Monthly Gross Salary)
• Calculate:
o Gross Monthly Salary = Basic Salary + Special Allowances
o Annual Gross Salary = (Gross Monthly Salary × 12) + Bonus
• Output:
o Display the employee details, gross monthly salary, and annual gross salary.

Level2:
Level 2: Taxable Income Calculation
Objective: Calculate taxable income after standard deductions.
Tasks:
• Deduct a Standard Deduction of ₹50,000 from the annual gross salary.
• Compute the Taxable Income and display all intermediate calculations.
Output: Display gross salary, standard deduction and taxable income.

Level 3: Tax and Rebate Calculation
Objective: Compute tax payable using the New Tax Regime (2023) slabs.
Tasks:
1. Calculate tax based on the following slabs:
o ₹0 - ₹3,00,000: 0%
o ₹3,00,001 - ₹6,00,000: 5%
o ₹6,00,001 - ₹9,00,000: 10%
o ₹9,00,001 - ₹12,00,000: 15%
o ₹12,00,001 - ₹15,00,000: 20%
o Above ₹15,00,000: 30%
2. Apply Section 87A Rebate:
o Taxable income ≤ ₹7,00,000 → 100% rebate (tax payable = ₹0).
3. Add a 4% Health and Education Cess to the calculated tax.
Output:
• Display a detailed tax breakdown, including slabs, cess, and total tax payable.

Farmer Problem Statement
Mahesh is a farmer and owns 80 acres of land. His land is equally divided into 5 segments.
He grows tomatoes in the 1st segment, potatoes in the 2nd segment, cabbage in the 3rd segment, sunflower in the 4th segment and sugarcane in the 5th segment.
He is converting his land from chemical-driven farming to chemical-free farming. Mahesh starts with the conversion of vegetables into chemical-free produce. He spends the first 6 months doing the same.
He then converts the sunflower land bank into chemical-free farming. This takes him another 4 months. Finally, he converts sugarcane into chemical-free farming over the next 4 months.
He gets a yield of the following for tomatoes. 30% of his tomato land gives him 10 tonne yield per acre.
The remaining 70% of his tomato land gives him 12 tonnes yield per acre. The selling price of tomato
is Rs. 7 per Kg.
The yield of potatoes is 10 tonnes per acre. He sells each kg at Rs. 20.
The yield of cabbage is 14 tonnes per acre. He sells each kg at Rs. 24.
The yield of sunflowers is 0.7 tonnes per acre. He sells each kg at Rs. 200.
The yield of sugarcane is 45 tonnes per acre. He sells each tonne at Rs. 4,000.
All the crops are sowed at the same time. Mahesh gets the above yield at the above-mentioned rate
in one crop cycle across his entire land of 80 acres.
What is
a. The overall sales achieved by Mahesh from the 80 acres of land.
b.   Sales realisation from chemical-free farming at the end of 11 months?'''
